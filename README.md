## Overview

Parallaxer is a declarative framework for establishing relationships between changing values 
in your application; use it to build delightful animations or tight controller interactions.

### Examples of parallax

- Slow moving backdrops in a side scrolling video game.
- Hour, minute and second hands on an analog watch. 
- A download progress indicator.
- Analog joystick controller input.

### `ParallaxTransform`: 

A parallax transform consists of a *parallax interval*, over which change is expected to occur,
as well as a *unit position*, a number between [0, 1], which serves as a reference point on that 
interval.

During your daily commute to work, you leave your home, hop on some form of transportation 
and eventually arrive at your destination. Along the way, you'll pass by various landmarks that you've
seen dozens of times before, which give you a sense of how close you are to your destination.

If you were to model your commute as a parallax transform, then its interval might be between 0
and 20 miles, or however far your commute is. The transform's unit position would indicate how
far you've gone at a particular point along the interval. Each landmark along your commute would 
be represented by a different unit position along the interval.

Transformations may be performed which alter the receiving transform's interval and/or its unit 
position. Each parallax transformation results in a new transform which preserves certain properties
from the original.

#### Supported transformations:

- `scale(to: ParallaxInterval)`
    - Alter the interval of the receiving transform, preserving its unit position.
- `reposition(with: PositionCurve)`
    - Alter the unit position of the receiving transform, preserving its interval.
- `focus(subinterval: ParallaxInterval)`
    - Alter both the interval and unit position of the receiving transform, preserving its parallax value.
    
### `ParallaxInterval`:

A parallax interval is a bidirectional interval with boundaries such that `from != to`; it specifies 
the interval over which change is expected to occur.

### `PositionCurve`:

A position curve affects how a unit position progresses over the unit interval: [0, 1].

## Usage

When envisioning a parallax effect, it helps to *think in terms of intervals*:
  - First identify what is changing.
  - Then determine the interval which best represents the boundary of that change. 

### Example - Custom scroll indicator

Let's add a custom scroll indicator to a vertical-scrolling `UIScrollView`. The scroll indicator 
shall be rendered with a `UIImageView`, and it shall move up and down in relation to the scroll view's
content offset.

How might we accomplish this with Parallaxer?

#### First, identify what is changing:

1) `UIScrollView.contentOffset` - Whenever the user slides their finger up or down on the scroll view, 
the view's content offset changes accordingly.
2) `UIImageView.center` - As the scroll view's content offset changes, so too shall the vertical position 
of the scroll indicator.

#### Next, determine parallax intervals for the changes we identified:

1) The maximum scrollable distance allowed by a scroll view is a function of its content size and frame size. 
We can calculate `scrollingInterval` like so:
    ```Swift
    let maxScrollDistanceY = scrollView.contentSize.height - scrollView.frame.height
    let scrollingInterval = ParallaxInterval(from: 0, to: maxScrollDistanceY)
    ```
2) The scroll indicator shall travel up and down the full height of the scroll view's frame; this is very straight-forward:
    ```Swift
    let indicatorPositionInterval = ParallaxInterval(from: 0, to: scrollView.frame.height)
    ```

#### Finally, relate these intervals to each other:

Whenever scrolling occurs, the content offset must be transformed into a scroll-indicator position. (If you guessed 
that `ParallaxTransform` can help with that, then please enjoy this freshly baked cookie: üç™.)
```Swift
// Create a transform representing the content offset of the scroll view.
let scrollingTransform = ParallaxTransform(
    interval: scrollingInterval,
    parallaxValue: scrollView.contentOffset.y)

// Relate the indicator's position to the scrolling transform.
let indicatorPositionTransform = scrollingTransform
    .scale(to: indicatorPositionInterval)
```

#### Tie it all together:
Using Parallaxer's RxSwift extensions, we can set all of this up declaratively in our view controller's `viewDidLoad()` 
method. 

```Swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // Set up views, layout, etc.
    ...

    // Calculate the scrolling interval, over which scrolling can occur.
    let maxScrollDistanceY = scrollView.contentSize.height - scrollView.frame.height
    let scrollingInterval = ParallaxInterval(from: 0, to: maxScrollDistanceY)

    // Create a transform representing the content offset of the scroll view.
    let scrollingTransform = scrollView.rx.contentOffset // RxCocoa.
        .map { return $0.y } // RxSwift.
        .parallax(over: scrollingInterval)

    // Determine the indicator's position interval, over which the indicator can move.
    let indicatorPositionInterval = ParallaxInterval(from: 0, to: scrollView.frame.height)

    // Relate the indicator's position to the scrolling transform.
    let indicatorPositionTransform = scrollingTransform
        .parallaxScale(to: indicatorPositionInterval)

    // Finally, bind the indicator parallax value to the image view's center point.
    indicatorPositionTransform
        .parallaxValue()
        .subscribe(onNext: { [unowned self] positionY in // RxSwift.
            self.indicatorImageView.center = CGPoint(
                x: self.scrollIndicator.center.x
                y: positionY)
        }
        .disposed(by: disposeBag) // RxSwift.
}
```
Note: I've commented the lines which use standard `RxSwift`/`RxCocoa` functions. Please see the 
[RxSwift documentation](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) if you have a question about those.
